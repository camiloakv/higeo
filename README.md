# Hello geographic data visualization

In this repository we play in Python with geographic data from the city of São Paulo. For now we used the following libraries: geopandas, pandas, matplotlib, numpy.

We focused on crime-related data for the year 2023 along with districts, hydrography and transport. The repository includes:
- Treated crime-related data.
- A general-usage data preparation notebook.
- A notebook for simple visualization.
- (soon) A notebook for interactive visualization.
